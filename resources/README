For the InstallerBuilder MSBuild project to work correctly, you must create a folder here called "spaceport-sdk" and put in all the relevent files for the Spaceport SDK. It will also be bundled into the updater package produced through the UpdatePacker project.

The "spaceport-sdk" folder will be installed to FlashDevelop/tools if it's being installed from the Launchpad installer, or it will reside in the tools/ directory if it's being packaged by the update packer.
