After using Adobe Air, I was absolutely disgusted with both the deployment times, and poor FlashDevelop integration.\r\n\r\nHaving to press more than one button to deploy my phone is absolutely unacceptable. This is where Launchpad comes in. Launchpad is built on top of Spaceport. Spaceport is a tool that allows you to compile and run your games on any mobile device, as well as HTML5 and the web. With Spaceport you can quickly deploy your game to 20 phones in a matter of seconds using Wifi; something that Air absolutely cannot do.\r\n\r\nSince Launchpad is well integrated into FlashDevelop, you never have to leave your comfortable IDE environment on windows while still utilizing iOS development. With the power of Spaceport, you can develop and deploy to iOS without ever paying for an apple developer account. Because you can push your game over Wifi, you can just download a free do-nothing app onto your phone that you can push to without even touching nasty provisioning profiles or certificates.","google":"UA-4040403-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
